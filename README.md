# ASA Conference on Statistical Practice
## Workshop: Principles of Prediciton and Inference in Machine Learning 

Machine learning and prediction methods are now ubiquitous in popular culture and academic research. While many popular prediction algorithms were developed outside of statistics, statisticians are expected to understand these algorithms, their principals and behavior. In addition, statisticians are often tasked with making inferences in the context of a complex prediction model. The purpose of this short course is to:

(1)	familiarize practitioners with essential principles for prediction and inference tasks using machine learners,   
(2)	explain the reliance on well-defined operating characteristics, particularly out-of-sample optimism and coverage,  
(3)	demonstrate how to compare and contrast the operating characteristics of machine learning and statistical models,  
(4)	promote the habit of using two aligned models, a prediction and inferential model, to meet specific scientific needs.   

We will emphasize the connection between prediction and attribution, emphasizing that prediction is often an easier task that comes at the expense of the ability to attribute predictive power to a particular feature. Sustained examples with R and group discussion are an integral part of the course
